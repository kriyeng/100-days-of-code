# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting, configuring and start adapting Total.js [blog Engine](https://github.com/totaljs/blogengine) to start my coding blog. Pushed to github, not published yet.

**Thoughts:** It's just the beginning of this journey and I'm not totally convinced how it'll go.

### Day 2: December 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Main today's work advanced yesterday due to christmans dinner. Custom styling the blog. Naming, top banner, favicon, ...

**Thoughts:** To not get stuck in the whole project I decided a name for the blog quickly. I will decide another one later.

### Day 3: December 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Prepared the server on a dedicated server I own. Cloned the repository, installed dependencies, configured the environment. Configured an IIS to redirect my DNS on port 80 to my Node.js on port 9009.

**Thoughts:** I own a windows deidcated server. I taked the advantage and I configured IIS to route my DNS to my Node.js.

### Day 4: December 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a fake project for tutorial purpose, with some basic HTML and CSS to start working on the tutorial. Commited to Github

**Thoughts:** Hard day after christmas, but I finally got focus. Some basic HTML and CSS for the fake project

### Day 5: December 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Restyled the default theme of the blog and pushed to server.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it's hard to restyle something existing that start from scratch based on some idea.

### Day 6: December 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Prepared code and wrote my very first post about coding. Refactoring an array of asynchronous functions

**Thoughts:** I realised how dificult is to explain things in a clear way. I think that if someone reads my post wouldn't get the point at all. I think I have to continue practicing

### Day 7: December 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Lazy day today, no coding on any project. Only struggled with some kata in codewars.

**Thoughts:** Hard day to find motivation. I just thinked to quit the challenge

### Day 8: December 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Coded all the logic for the API connection. Full working version for the tutorial purpose.

**Thoughts:** Good day today.

### Day 9: January 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote a blog post about my code and personal goals for 2019. It's the first time I set goals for myself. I'm focusing on small achievable goals instead of grandiloquent and unachievable ones..

**Thoughts:** I think that setting small goals will push me to accomplish them.

### Day 10: January 2, 2019 Finally published the blog post about my goals after reviewing it and done one kata on @codewars about [multiplying strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55911ef14065454c75000062)

**Thoughts:** I'm eager to see what I'm able to acomplish.

### Day 11: January 3, 2019 Some minor fixes in the code for the tutorial Demystifing Frameworks and reading about improving writing on blog posts. 

**Thoughts:** I think I prefer to learn more deeply how to blog before starting to write the tutorial.
