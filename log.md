### Day 2: December 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Main today's work advanced yesterday due to christmans dinner. Custom styling the blog. Naming, top banner, favicon, ...

**Thoughts:** To not get stuck in the whole project I decided a name for the blog quickly. I will decide another one later.

### Day 3: December 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Prepared the server on a dedicated server I own. Cloned the repository, installed dependencies, configured the environment. Configured an IIS to redirect my DNS on port 80 to my Node.js on port 9009.

**Thoughts:** I own a windows deidcated server. I taked the advantage and I configured IIS to route my DNS to my Node.js.

### Day 4: December 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a fake project for tutorial purpose, with some basic HTML and CSS to start working on the tutorial. Commited to Github

### Day 5: December 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Restyled the default theme of the blog and pushed to server.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes it's hard to restyle something existing that start from scratch based on some idea.
