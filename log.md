# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting, configuring and start adapting Total.js [blog Engine](https://github.com/totaljs/blogengine) to start my coding blog. Pushed to github, not published yet.

**Thoughts:** It's just the beginning of this journey and I'm not totally convinced how it'll go.
