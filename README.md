# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

After a few days thinking to enroll or not, I've finally decide to enroll to the challenge. I'm developing at work and with two daughters, my time for side/fun projects are very limited and needs a lot of willpower to go for them. I have some ideas that I'll try to develop during this challenge.

* Creating my own blog
* I little side project that I never started
* And idea that I have to work more on it before finally share

## My coding blog

As a coder for more than 15 years I think I can start to overcome my impostor syndrome! This is the first reason to start this journey.

I know, there're infinite blogs, webs and every kind of stuff related to coding topics. I'll write this in the first place for myself. I read a lot of articles and opinions and I never find myself reflected in those points of view completely.
Otherwise, I'm trying to improve and strengthen my programming knowledge and I always listened that the best way to know what you really know is to try to teach and write about these concepts.

My first days on the challenge will be dedicated to code my blog and start writing some ideas, preparing code for these articles. When finished my first article series I will point to the second part. 

Let's start on in and we'll see!
