# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Getting, configuring and start adapting Total.js [blog Engine](https://github.com/totaljs/blogengine) to start my coding blog. Pushed to github, not published yet.

**Thoughts:** It's just the beginning of this journey and I'm not totally convinced how it'll go.

### Day 2: December 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Main today's work advanced yesterday due to christmans dinner. Custom styling the blog. Naming, top banner, favicon, ...

**Thoughts:** To not get stuck in the whole project I decided a name for the blog quickly. I will decide another one later.

### Day 3: December 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Prepared the server on a dedicated server I own. Cloned the repository, installed dependencies, configured the environment. Configured an IIS to redirect my DNS on port 80 to my Node.js on port 9009.

**Thoughts:** I own a windows deidcated server. I taked the advantage and I configured IIS to route my DNS to my Node.js.
